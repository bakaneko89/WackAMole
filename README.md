Whack a Mole VR Game

This is a sample code for a VR game that was developed during the course:
https://www.udemy.com/build-30-mini-virtual-reality-games-in-unity-3d-from-scratch/

The Mole as well as the arcade room models were built on Blender. 

There is an issue still with the exact positioning of the hammer that needs to be adjusted.

Need to add levels and enhance the experience more.
